Now that your basic setup is ready, over the next few weeks you will implement the concepts you are learning in search problems through Pacman projects (project 1: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj1/). There are 8 questions and all questions are compulsory. 
- Systematically go through the instructions provided in the link above, work out the commands listed and observe the outputs. This will give you a better idea on how the code works. The comments in the code should also guide you through. In some of the relevant functions in search.py, you will see some snippets of code commented out. Running those will also help you to understand the specific search problem representations used.
- For data structures like stacks, queues and priority queues etc you are allowed to use the implementation provided in util.py.  (For additional coding fun, you can later separately try to implement these data structures).
-  Please include relevant comments in your code to help us understand your ideas/search model/implementations (especially for Questions 5, 6, 7, 8).
- Though not asked explicitly in the web page try to also figure out various aspects being done in class, for example, space complexity of various algos.
Files to be submitted:
