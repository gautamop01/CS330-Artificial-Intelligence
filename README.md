# CS330-Artificial-Intelligence

## Lab Assignment 0

#### The first task is designed to warm you up for the programming component of this course. You will recap python and familiarize yourself with Berkeley University's CS 188 Pacman projects framework. Please go through the instructions on https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj0/ to setup python 3.6 environment for the lab. Additionally the framework comes with an autograder, which will be useful to verify if you are on track as you build your solutions.  Please note that the autograder could possibly throw errors for later versions of python. So please ensure that you work on a python 3.6 environment.
Once you have set up the environment, answer questions 1, 2 and 3 of https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj0/. These are very simple warm up questions and as you answer them please explore how to use the autograder to verify (and possibly debug) your solutions.
Please ensure that you only fill up the code within the functions specified in the instructions. Do not make any other edits: For example you should not change other files, or any of the function names/arguments.
You need to edit and submit only the following files:
1. addition.py, 
2. buyLotsOfFruit.py, and 
3. shopSmart.py

## Lab Assignment 1
#### Now that your basic setup is ready, over the next few weeks you will implement the concepts you are learning in search problems through Pacman projects (project 1: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj1/). There are 8 questions and all questions are compulsory. 
- Systematically go through the instructions provided in the link above, work out the commands listed and observe the outputs. This will give you a better idea on how the code works. The comments in the code should also guide you through. In some of the relevant functions in search.py, you will see some snippets of code commented out. Running those will also help you to understand the specific search problem representations used.
- For data structures like stacks, queues and priority queues etc you are allowed to use the implementation provided in util.py.  (For additional coding fun, you can later separately try to implement these data structures).
-  Please include relevant comments in your code to help us understand your ideas/search model/implementations (especially for Questions 5, 6, 7, 8).
- Though not asked explicitly in the web page try to also figure out various aspects being done in class, for example, space complexity of various algos.
Files to be submitted:
 1.  search.py
 2.  searchAgents.py
## Lab Assignment 2
#### You will apply the concepts you are learning in handling multiple agents with Pacman projects (project 2: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj2/). There are 5 questions and all questions are compulsory. As in the previous assignment, following the instructions and documentation systematically will help you develop code. 
-  You are allowed to code helper functions.
-  Please include relevant comments in your code to help us understand your ideas/imple

## Lab Assignment 3A

#### Lab assignment 3 is divided into two parts of which part A is now open. The assignment deals with MDPs, value iteration and policy iteration algorithms that you are seeing in class. You will need to develop code from scratch for this assignment. You can do your implementation in either python, C or C++.
Files to be submitted:
- Code files
- Brief report with answers to the specific questions asked.

## Lab Assignment 3B

#### You will apply the concepts in MDPs and Reinforcement learning in applications like gridworld, pacman etc. (project 3: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj3/). All questions listed on the page are compulsory. Also at the end of the instructions here in classroom, you will find two additional optional questions for bonus credit.As in the previous assignments, following the instructions and documentation systematically will help you develop code. Please include relevant comments in your code to help us understand your ideas/implementations.Files to be submitted:
1. valueIterationAgents.py
2. qlearningAgents.py
3. analysis.py

## Lab Assignment 4

#### You will now implement concepts you are learning in Bayesian Networks through Project 4 of the 2021 offering of CS188: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp21/project4/ (as in the previous assignments, following the instructions and documentation systematically will help you develop code).Please include relevant comments in your code to help us understand your ideas/implementations. Files to be submitted:
1. factorOperations.py
2. inference.py
3. bayesAgents.py

## Lab Assignment 5

#### Develop code from scratch to compute an input query probability on a given Bayes net using Prior sampling, Rejection Sampling, Likelihood weighting and Gibbs sampling. You will also need to write a helper function to generate samples from any input univariate distribution and then use it in your Bayes Net sampling code. Your code should be generic and should produce a correct result for any input Bayes net involving discrete random variables. You may code in Python/C/C++. The input needs to be provided in a .txt file as per the general format below: No. of random variables, list of random variables, Random variables and possible values, Conditional probability tables, Query probability #### An example format with the alarm Bayes net discussed in class is attached.
