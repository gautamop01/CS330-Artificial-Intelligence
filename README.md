## Lab Assignment 1

## Lab Assignment 2

## Lab Assignment 3

#### You will apply the concepts in MDPs and Reinforcement learning in applications like gridworld, pacman etc. (project 3: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj3/). All questions listed on the page are compulsory. Also at the end of the instructions here in classroom, you will find two additional optional questions for bonus credit.As in the previous assignments, following the instructions and documentation systematically will help you develop code. Please include relevant comments in your code to help us understand your ideas/implementations.Files to be submitted:
1. valueIterationAgents.py
2. qlearningAgents.py
3. analysis.py

## Lab Assignment 4

#### You will now implement concepts you are learning in Bayesian Networks through Project 4 of the 2021 offering of CS188: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp21/project4/ (as in the previous assignments, following the instructions and documentation systematically will help you develop code).Please include relevant comments in your code to help us understand your ideas/implementations. Files to be submitted:
1. factorOperations.py
2. inference.py
3. bayesAgents.py

## Lab Assignment 5

#### Develop code from scratch to compute an input query probability on a given Bayes net using Prior sampling, Rejection Sampling, Likelihood weighting and Gibbs sampling. You will also need to write a helper function to generate samples from any input univariate distribution and then use it in your Bayes Net sampling code. Your code should be generic and should produce a correct result for any input Bayes net involving discrete random variables. You may code in Python/C/C++. The input needs to be provided in a .txt file as per the general format below: No. of random variables, list of random variables, Random variables and possible values, Conditional probability tables, Query probability #### An example format with the alarm Bayes net discussed in class is attached.
