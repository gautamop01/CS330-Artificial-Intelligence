## Lab Assignment 5

#### Develop code from scratch to compute an input query probability on a given Bayes net using Prior sampling, Rejection Sampling, Likelihood weighting and Gibbs sampling. You will also need to write a helper function to generate samples from any input univariate distribution and then use it in your Bayes Net sampling code. Your code should be generic and should produce a correct result for any input Bayes net involving discrete random variables. You may code in Python/C/C++. The input needs to be provided in a .txt file as per the general format below:
### No. of random variables, list of random variables, Random variables and possible values, Conditional probability tables, Query probability #### An example format with the alarm Bayes net discussed in class is attached.
