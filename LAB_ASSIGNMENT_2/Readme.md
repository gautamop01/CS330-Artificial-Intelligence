You will apply the concepts you are learning in handling multiple agents with Pacman projects (project 2: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj2/). There are 5 questions and all questions are compulsory. As in the previous assignment, following the instructions and documentation systematically will help you develop code. 
-  You are allowed to code helper functions.
-  Please include relevant comments in your code to help us understand your ideas/implementations.Files to be submitted:
1. multiagents.py
- Include the group number and the names, roll numbers of the members as comments in the beginning of all files which you are submitting. 
- Remember that all members of the group should contribute well - there will be vivas/discussions in every lab session.
- You are also expected to be honest - Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
- Over the instructions in the page,  explore various layouts/ghost settings  to better analyse how the agents play.-
